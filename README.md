<h1>Superstore Marketing</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This SQL project analyzes customer behavior in a superstore marketing context by segmenting customers into distinct "Tiers" based on their most recent visit date. Using customer data, the project creates these Tiers to better understand the relationship between customer engagement and demographic characteristics. Key metrics like average age, education level, income, and frequency of purchases or web visits are calculated for each Tier, offering insights into the shopping habits and preferences of different customer segments. By identifying trends within each Tier, this analysis helps tailor marketing strategies and improve customer targeting for the superstore.
